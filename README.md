# NoSlowHaste
Windower 4 addon for FFXI to monitor and cancel haste spell casted by trust.

This allow to automatically remove haste I (15% speed) casted by a trust if it was not overrided by Haste II (30% speed) shortly before or after it landed on yourself. Once removed, it will allow another trust, like Koru-Moru or King of Hearts to cast a more favorable Haste II on yourself.
